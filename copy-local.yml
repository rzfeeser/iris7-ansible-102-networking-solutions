- name: Playbook 2 - Copy to localhost (local artifact generation)
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure artifacts directory exists locally
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: ./artifacts
        state: directory
        mode: "0755"

    - name: Create a local artifact file using copy
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        dest: ./artifacts/local-copy-demo.txt
        mode: "0644"
        content: |
          This file was created on localhost by ansible.builtin.copy.
          This pattern is useful for generating reports, logs, and build artifacts.
